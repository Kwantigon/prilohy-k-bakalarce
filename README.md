This repository contains attachments for my bachelor thesis, which are:
- Source file and documentation for the TextConverter tool.
- Testsets used for the training.
- Output files from QuickJudge used for the manual annotation.

What this repository *does not* contain are all the marian models as they are way too big.
These models are stored at MetaCentrum and I can access them at any time.
